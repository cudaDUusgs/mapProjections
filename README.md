# mapProjections

#### This repository will include information and files about the collaboration project between USGS CEGIS' Michael P. Finn, the University of Denver's Geography and the Environment professor Dr. Jing Li, and David Mattli, titled "Small-Scale Raster Map Projection using the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA)." This project was presented at the ISPRS Tecnical Commission fourth Symposium on Geospatial Databases and Location Based Services, in Suzhou, China, on May of 2014.

#### Information presented will cover the design and methods used in the project, motivation behind the research, results, and examples of the CUDA based implementations from the map projections (GPU dominate environment).
